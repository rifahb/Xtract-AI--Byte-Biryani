# 📚 Library Data Analysis & AI-Driven Recommendations  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **library borrowing trends** and builds an **AI-powered book recommendation system** based on user behavior. We cleaned messy data, extracted meaningful insights, and visualized key trends using AI tools.  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  
### **"Analyzing Borrowing Trends & Using AI to Recommend Books"**  
Libraries hold vast amounts of data on book circulation, but **manual analysis is time-consuming**. Our goal is to:  
✅ Identify key borrowing patterns 📊  
✅ Detect seasonal & genre-based trends 📆📚  
✅ Develop an AI-based recommendation system 🤖  

---

## 📌 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
The raw dataset contained multiple **inconsistencies, missing values, and mixed data types**. We performed:  
- ✅ **Date Formatting** – Standardized all date values 🗓  
- ✅ **Duplicate Removal** – Eliminated redundant records 🚮  
- ✅ **Missing Value Handling** – Used interpolation & mode filling 📌  
- ✅ **Column Standardization** – Fixed inconsistencies in book titles, user IDs, etc. 🛠  
- ✅ **Data Type Corrections** – Converted numeric fields & categorical variables 🔄  

---

## 📌 📊 Insights & Visualizations  
We used **Looker Studio, Pandas Profiling, and Matplotlib** to generate key insights:  

1️⃣ **Monthly Borrowing Trends** – Peaks & dips in circulation 📅  
2️⃣ **Top Borrowed Books & Genres** – Most popular titles & themes 📚  
3️⃣ **User Borrowing Patterns** – Frequent readers & borrowing frequency 👥  
4️⃣ **AI-Based Book Recommendations** – Suggesting books based on reading history 🤖  
5️⃣ **Heatmaps & Correlations** – Finding relationships between books & borrowing behavior 🔥
